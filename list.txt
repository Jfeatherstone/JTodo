# The following file is generated by jTodo whenever it writes to the file, and user additions will most likely
# be overwritten on next write. To edit settings, use the config generator (todo --mkconfig) (WIP) or specific commands
# that can be found by using "todo -h".

# Todo tasks:

# Enabling groups will display the current tasks in group form (which is specified by todo -a <task> <-g <group>>
:enable_groups=true # Possible values: true or 1 will enable, while false or 0 will disable
